The bulk arp spoof code will do a bulk arp poision for all the devices in the subnet. It also can disrubt the communication of the intermediary devices in the subnet if the attacker knows the DGW of these intermediary devices

The basic arp spoof will do a simple arp poison. The attacker just need to change the ips and the MACs.
